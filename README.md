## Forage-task-Tata-Data-Visualisation-Empowering-Business-with-Effective-Insights
### An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.
1. Create a set of four questions that you anticipate each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to. 
* What was the highest unit price sold
* What was the revenue generated from customers with repeat purchases.
* For the repeat customers, how long does it take for them to place the next order after being delivered the previous one?
* Which stock type had the most sales
* What is the monthly trend of revenue, which months have faced the biggest increase/decrease?
* Which country had the highest stock revenue and which country had the least stock revenue.
* Which month had the highest sales revenue and which month had the least sales revenue.
* Which customer has bought the most stocks and how much stock did they buy.
* What is the percentage of customers that are repeat buyers and whether they are buying the same product?
* Which customers have the most repeat purchases and are they buying the same product?
2. Come up with the perfect visual which will illustrate what the senior managers are looking for in each scenario. Remember, data can be presented in multiple types of charts, but you are required to select the visual that would best display the information which is being presented.
